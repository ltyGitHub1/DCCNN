# DCCNN
The program (DCCNN_three_prisms) is designed for calculating the potential field downward continuation. Users can change the experimental data according to their own needs.

‘kernel_3prisms.mat’ is the matrix K in the paper.

‘three_prism_0m.mat’ is the synthetic anomaly data at z = 0 km.

‘three_prism_1000m.mat’ is the synthetic anomaly data at z = 1 km.

‘data_3prisms_2.5z.mat’ is the observation data with 2.5% noise.

‘data_3prisms_5z.mat’ is the observation data with 5% noise.
